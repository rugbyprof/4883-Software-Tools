## Assignment 4 - Graphviz BST
#### Due: 06-7-2023 (Wednesday @ 10:10 a.m.)


### Overview

Create a binary search tree using graphviz that contains seven nodes and uses a record as its shape. The record should have  `left` `data` `right` sections. 

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A04` to place your assignment files in. 
- Create a file to hold the dot syntax used to create your binary tree and name it:  `bst.dot`
- Get the output image from your dot code and name it `bst.png` (or jpg or gif or whatever image format its in).
- Place both files and a `README.md` in the `A04` folder within your assignments folder.
- Look [HERE](../../Resources/01-Readmees/README.md) for information on creating good README's for your projects.
