>**1**. Any projects that include programs as well as programs themselves must run without error. If they do not run, they will not be graded. Correctness is a different matter. However, the program must be close to the solution required and cannot be an over simplified version simply for the purpose of making it run. 

### Attendance: 

Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. Students with excessive absences may be reported to the dean of students and may receive a grade of F in the class. There is no distinction made between excused and unexcused. Make-up exams will be given only if the student has a reasonable excuse and if the instructor is contacted within 24 hours of the exam and arrangements are made for the make-up prior to the next class meeting. NO make-ups will be given for missed quizzes. Students are expected to be in the classroom when class begins and stay the entire period.


### Academic Misconduct Policy & Procedures

Cheating, collusion, and plagiarism (the act of using source material of other persons, either published or unpublished, without following the accepted techniques of crediting, or the submission for credit of work not the individual’s to whom credit is given . The Department of Computer Science has adopted the following policy related to cheating (academic misconduct). The policy will be applied to all instances of cheating on assignments and exams as determined by the instructor of the course. (See below for link to MSU definitions.)

- 1st instance of cheating in a course: The student will be assigned a non-replaceable grade of zero for the assignment, project or exam. If the resulting grade does not result in a letter grade reduction, the student will receive a one letter grade reduction in course.
- 2nd instance of cheating in a course: The student will receive a grade of F in course & immediately be removed from course.
- All instances of cheating will be reported to the Department Chair and, in the case of graduate students, to the Department Graduate Coordinator.

Note: Letting a student look at your work is collusion and is academic misconduct!
